This file indicates that the development environment is used, simply by it's
existance.

If you want to use the production environment on your server
  * just delete this file, or
  * change the lines in config.php to set the production-environment in a
    different way. 
    WARNING: Do not use $_SERVER['name'] to determine the environment. It will
    not work with Command line skripts (e.g. when you want to migrate your 
    database).
    Use 
    mb_strpos(dirname(__FILE__), 'a_specific_folder_on_server_path') !== FALSE)
    to determine the production environment instead.
